      Welcome to camply, the campsite finder.

      Finding reservations at sold out campgrounds can be tough. That's where
      camply comes in. It searches the APIs of booking services like
      https://recreation.gov (which indexes thousands of campgrounds across the
      USA) to continuously check for cancellations and availabilities to pop up.
      Once a campsite becomes available, camply sends you a notification to book
      your spot!

      visit the camply documentation at https://github.com/juftin/camply
