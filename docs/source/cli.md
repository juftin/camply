Usage: camply [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Welcome to camply, the campsite finder.

  Finding reservations at sold out campgrounds can be tough. That's where
  camply comes in. It searches the APIs of booking services like
  https://recreation.gov (which indexes thousands of campgrounds across the
  USA) to continuously check for cancellations and availabilities to pop up.
  Once a campsite becomes available, camply sends you a notification to book
  your spot!
