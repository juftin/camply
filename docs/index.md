**`camply`**, the campsite finder ‚õ∫Ô∏è, is a tool to help you book a campground online. Finding
reservations at sold out campgrounds can be tough. That's where camply comes in. It searches the
APIs of booking services like https://recreation.gov (which indexes thousands of campgrounds across
the USA) to continuously check for cancellations and availabilities to pop up. Once a campsite
becomes available, camply sends you a notification to book your spot!
