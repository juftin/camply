`camply`, the campsite finder, is a tool to help you book an online campground. Finding reservations
at sold out campgrounds can be tough. That's where `camply` comes in. It scrapes the APIs of Booking
Services like https://recreation.gov (which works on thousands of campgrounds across the USA) to
continuously check for cancellations and availabilities to pop up. Once a campsite becomes
available, `camply` sends you a notification to book your spot!

#### Look for weekend campsite availabilities

This below search looks across larger periods of time, but only if a campground is available to book
on a Friday or Saturday night (`--weekends`). It also uses the `--polling-interval` argument which
checks every 5 minutes instead of the default 10 minutes.

```shell
camply campsites \
    --rec-area-id 2991 \
    --start-date 2021-05-01 \
    --end-date 2021-07-31 \
    --weekends \
    --continuous \
    --notifications email \

#### Look for a campsite inside of Yellowstone

Yellowstone doesn't use https://recreation.gov to manage its campgrounds, instead it uses its own
proprietary system. In order to search the Yellowstone API for campsites, make sure to pass
the `--provider "yellowstone"` argument. This flag disables `--rec-area-id` and `--campground`
arguments. Notice how `camply` throws a warning: `"Found matching campsites on the first try!
Switching to Silent Notifications..."`. When camply is told to run `--continuous` and it finds
matching sites on the first try, it just logs the campsites quietly. To bypass this behavior, pass
the `--notify-first-try` argument

```shell
camply campsites \
    --provider yellowstone \
    --start-date 2021-06-09 \
    --end-date 2021-06-16 \
    --continuous
```

### Finding Recreation Areas and Campgrounds without Using the Command Line

You can uncover campground and recreation area IDs just by using the https://recreation.gov search
functionality. Use the below example for a campground within Glacier National Park.

First, perform your search on https://recreation.gov
<p>
<img src="docs/static/recreation_dot_gov.png" width="500" alt="recreation_dot_gov search">
</p>

The above search will take you to a URL like this:
https://www.recreation.gov/search?q=Glacier%20National%20Park&entity_id=2725&entity_type=recarea.
Taking a closer look at the URL components you can see that Glacier National Park has the Recreation
Area ID #2725.

Searching deeper you might mind a place like Fish Creek Campground at a URL
like https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232493. Here, we can see that this campground
has a Campground ID of #232493 (and it also sits inside of Recreation Area ID #2725)

### Object Oriented Usage

#### Object-Oriented Campsite Search:

```python
from datetime import datetime
import logging
from typing import List

from camply.containers import AvailableCampsite, SearchWindow
from camply.search import SearchRecreationDotGov

logging.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s [%(levelname)8s]: %(message)s",
                    level=logging.INFO)

month_of_june = SearchWindow(start_date=datetime(year=2021, month=6, day=1),
                             end_date=datetime(year=2021, month=6, day=30))
camping_finder = SearchRecreationDotGov(search_window=month_of_june,
                                        recreation_area=2725,  # Glacier Ntl Park
                                        weekends_only=False)
matches: List[AvailableCampsite] = camping_finder.get_matching_campsites(log=True, verbose=True,
                                                                         continuous=False)
```

The above script returns a list of any matching `AvailableCampsite` objects:

```python
[
    AvailableCampsite(campsite_id='5391',
                      booking_date=datetime.datetime(2021, 6, 13, 0, 0),
                      campsite_site_name='B37',
                      campsite_loop_name='Loop B',
                      campsite_type='STANDARD NONELECTRIC',
                      campsite_occupancy=(0, 8),
                      campsite_use_type='Overnight',
                      availability_status='Available',
                      recreation_area='Glacier National Park, MT',
                      recreation_area_id='2725',
                      facility_name='Fish Creek Campground',
                      facility_id='232493',
                      booking_url='https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campsites/5391')
]
```

## Dependencies

I've tried to build this module pretty simply. Everything is built on Python 3. This particular
project was built in Python `3.8.X`, but any version of Python 3 should suffice. Currently, there
are four required packages, the underlying code has been implemented to be friendly across a wide
range of supported package versions.

- [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
    - The `requests` package is used to fetch data from the APIs of Camping Booking Providers
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
    - The `pandas` package is to group and aggregate across large data sets of campsites,
      campgrounds, and recreation areas.
- [pyyaml](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML)
    - The `pyyaml` package is used to parse YAML files for campsite search configurations
- [tenacity](https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - The `tenacity` package is used for retrying data fetches from some APIs. This retrying
      methodology handles exceptions allowing for API downtime and facilitating exponential backoff.
- [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)
    - The `python-dotenv` ¬¨package reads key-value pairs from a `.env` file and can set them as
      environment variables.
