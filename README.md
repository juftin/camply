**`camply`**, the campsite finder ⛺️, is a tool to help you book a campsite online. Finding
reservations at sold out campgrounds can be tough. That's where camply comes in. It searches
thousands of campgrounds across the ~~USA~~ world via the APIs of booking services like
[recreation.gov](https://recreation.gov). It continuously checks for cancellations and
availabilities to pop up - once a campsite becomes available, camply sends you a notification
to book your spot!
