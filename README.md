`camply`, the campsite finder, is a tool to help you book an online campground. Finding reservations
at sold out campgrounds can be tough. That's where `camply` comes in. It scrapes the APIs of Booking
Services like https://recreation.gov (which works on thousands of campgrounds across the USA) to
continuously check for cancellations and availabilities to pop up. Once a campsite becomes
available, `camply` sends you a notification to book your spot!

## Important Notice

`camply` is still under active development and is not fully ready. Once this project is fully ready
code will be released to a `main` branch. If you'd like to contribute to the project please reach
out.

#### Look for weekend campsite availabilities

This below search looks across larger periods of time, but only if a campground is available to book
on a Friday or Saturday night (`--weekends`). It also uses the `--polling-interval` argument which
checks every 5 minutes instead of the default 10 minutes.

```shell
camply campsites \
    --rec-area-id 2991 \
    --start-date 2021-05-01 \
    --end-date 2021-07-31 \

#### Look for a campsite inside of Yellowstone

Yellowstone doesn't use https://recreation.gov to manage its campgrounds, instead it uses its own
proprietary system. In order to search the Yellowstone API for campsites, make sure to pass
the `--provider "yellowstone"` argument. This flag disables `--rec-area-id` and `--campground`
arguments. Notice how `camply` throws a warning: `"Found matching campsites on the first try!
Switching to Silent Notifications..."`. When camply is told to run `--continuous` and it finds
matching sites on the first try, it just logs the campsites quietly. To bypass this behavior, pass
the `--notify-first-try` argument

```shell
camply campsites \
    --provider yellowstone \
    --start-date 2021-06-09 \
    --end-date 2021-06-16 \
    --continuous
```

### Finding Recreation Areas and Campgrounds without Using the Commandline (`recreation.gov`)

You can uncover campground and recreation area IDs just by using the https://recreation.gov search
functionality. Use the below example for a campground within Glacier National Park.

First, perform your search on https://recreation.gov
<p>
<img src="docs/static/recreation_dot_gov.png" swidth="500" alt="recreation_dot_gov search">
</p>

The above search will take you to a URL like
this: https://www.recreation.gov/search?q=Glacier%20National%20Park&entity_id=2725&entity_type=recarea
. Taking a closer look at the URL you can see that Glacier National Park has the 
Recreation Area ID #2725.

Searching deeper you might mind a place like Fish Creek Campground at a URL
like https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232493. Here, we can see that this campground
has a Campground ID of #232493 (and it also sits inside of Recreation Area ID #2725)

### Object Oriented Usage

#### Object-Oriented Campsite Search:

```python
from datetime import datetime
import logging

from camply.containers import SearchWindow
from camply.search import SearchRecreationDotGov

logging.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s [%(levelname)8s]: %(message)s",
                    level=logging.INFO)

month_of_june = SearchWindow(start_date=datetime(year=2021, month=6, day=1),
                             end_date=datetime(year=2021, month=6, day=30))
camping_finder = SearchRecreationDotGov(search_window=month_of_june,
                                        recreation_area=2725,  # Glacier Ntl Park
                                        weekends_only=False)
matches = camping_finder.get_matching_campsites(log=True, verbose=True, continuous=False)
```

## Dependencies

I've tried to build this module pretty simply. Everything is built on Python 3. This particular
project was built in Python `3.8.X`, but any version of Python 3 should suffice. Currently, there
are four required packages, the underlying code has been implemented to be friendly across a wide
range of supported package versions.

- [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
    - The `requests` package is used to fetch data from the APIs of Camping Booking Providers
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
    - The `pandas` package is to group and aggregate across large data sets of campsites,
      campgrounds, and recreation areas.
- [pyyaml](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML)
    - The `pyyaml` package is used to parse YAML files for campsite search configurations
- [tenacity](https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - The `tenacity` package is used for retrying data fetches from some APIs. This retrying
      methodology handles exceptions allowing for API downtime and facilitating exponential backoff.

These packages can all be installed via pip:

```shell
pip install requests pandas pyyaml tenacity
```
