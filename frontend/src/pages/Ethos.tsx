                Popular campgrounds book up within minutes of reservations
                opening. Families plan months ahead, only to find their dream
                campsite unavailable. The current system favors those with
                flexible schedules and constant internet access. The result is
                that working families, first-time campers, and those without
                technical know-how are left out in the cold.

                Online camping reservation providers have generous cancellation

                in. We monitor these campgrounds 24/7, so you don't have to. Our
                goal is to level the playing field and give everyone equal

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    In 2020, my partner and I took a road trip from our home in
                    Denver, Colorado through Grand Teton and Yellowstone
                    National Parks and up to Glacier National Park in Montana.
                    This trip was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
                    campsites were hard to come by. We planned the trip without
                    having any reservations locked down.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    I ended up paying for a service that would monitor campsite
                    availability and notify me when something opened up.
                    Unfortunately, it didn't support every campground we were
                    hoping to stay in along the way. So I decided to buiild
                    something to to do it myself. We ended up being able to
                    secure a campsite everywhere we traveled throughout the
                    trip.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-0">
                    My wife and I ended up getting engaged at Iceberg Lake in
                    Glacier National Park on that trip. We stayed in Many
                    Glacier Campground that night with a beautiful view of the
                    mountains under the stars. Since then, I've been proud to
                    share camply with others to help them find those same
                    camping opportunities for free ‚Äî and I hope to help you find
