                  camply was born from our own frustration with the camping
                  reservation system. Too many weekends were spent refreshing
                  booking websites, hoping for last-minute cancellations. Too
                  many camping trips were canceled because we couldn't secure a
                  spot.

                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    In 2020, my partner and I took a road trip from our home in
                    Denver, Colorado through Grand Teton and Yellowstone
                    National Parks and up to Glacier National Park in Montana.
                    This trip was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
                    campsites were hard to come by. We planned the trip without
                    having any reservations locked down.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    I ended up paying for a service that would monitor campsite
                    availability and notify me when something opened up.
                    Unfortunately it didn't support every campground we were
                    hoping to stay in along the way, so I decided to write my
                    own code to do it myself and we were able to secure a
                    campsite everywhere we needed throughout the trip.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-0">
                    My wife and I ended up getting engaged at Iceberg Lake in
                    Glacier National Park on that trip, we stayed in Many
                    Glacier Campground that night with a beautiful view of the
                    mountains under the stars. Since then, I've been proud to
                    share camply with others to help them find those same
                    camping opportunities for free - and I hope to help you find
