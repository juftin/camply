                  Basin Group Campground, situated high in the rugged Chisos Mountains, is one
                  of the most sought-after campgrounds in Big Bend National Park. It has seven
                  group camping sites available for groups of nine to 20 people (size is site-dependent).
                  At an altitude of 5,400 ft., the campground is surrounded on all sides by
                  tall, rocky cliffs and conveniently located near some of the park''s most
                  spectacular and popular trails. The Rio Grande is only a short drive away.   \n\nAlso
                  found in the area is the Chisos Basin Visitor Center, the General Store and
                  the Chisos Mountains Lodge, which houses the only restaurant in Big Bend National
                  Park.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThis campground is a hub for hikers. Some of the
                  park''s most spectacular and popular trails are nearby, including the Lost
                  Mine Trail, the Window Trail, the South Rim Trail and the Pinnacles Trail,
                  with its access to the park''s highest point, Emory Peak (elevation 7,825
                  ft.). Campers can find the trailheads for most of these trails in the main
                  Chisos Basin area a mile or so further down the Basin road from the campground.   \n\nAccess
                  to the river is approximately 30 miles away, where visitors can canoe, kayak
                  and fish.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The group campground is located approximately
                  1/4 mile away from the main Chisos Basin Campground. Each site comes with
                  a picnic table, charcoal grill and bear-proof food storage container and some
                  sites come with picnic shelters for shade. All campsites are within easy walking
                  distance to drinking water and toilets. No RVs, trailers, or generators are
                  allowed.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe national park is named for a
                  curve in the Rio Grande called the \"big bend.\" For 1,250 miles, the river
                  is an International Boundary between the United States and Mexico.   \n\nThe
                  campground lies at the base of several sloping cliffs amidst montane shrubland;
                  desert plants such as Arizona cyprus and mesquite trees fill the landscape.
                  Maple, aspen, pinyon and ponderosa pines grow at higher elevations just above
                  the campground. Though it is lower than the surrounding cliffs, the Chisos
                  Basin is at a higher elevation than other campgrounds within the park. Summer
                  temperatures here are cool, yet warmer than other areas in fall and winter
                  due to the cold air sinking into lower regions.   \n\nThe Chisos Mountains
                  are a popular nesting site for migratory birds. The mountains provide the
                  only nesting ground in the United States for the Colima Warbler, which arrives
                  in mid-April and departs for its wintering grounds in southwestern Mexico
                  by mid-September.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nBig Bend National Park encompasses
                  801,000 acres and the Chisos Basin area is centrally located. This allows
                  visitors an excellent opportunity to explore all areas of the park in a relatively
                  short drive. Big Bend offers excellent hiking trails, miles of rugged dirt
                  roads, and endless possibilities for sightseeing. ","FacilityDirections":"From

                  Basin Group Campground, situated high in the rugged Chisos Mountains, is one
                  of the most sought-after campgrounds in Big Bend National Park. It has seven
                  group camping sites available for groups of nine to 20 people (size is site-dependent).
                  At an altitude of 5,400 ft., the campground is surrounded on all sides by
                  tall, rocky cliffs and conveniently located near some of the park''s most
                  spectacular and popular trails. The Rio Grande is only a short drive away.   \n\nAlso
                  found in the area is the Chisos Basin Visitor Center, the General Store and
                  the Chisos Mountains Lodge, which houses the only restaurant in Big Bend National
                  Park.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThis campground is a hub for hikers. Some of the
                  park''s most spectacular and popular trails are nearby, including the Lost
                  Mine Trail, the Window Trail, the South Rim Trail and the Pinnacles Trail,
                  with its access to the park''s highest point, Emory Peak (elevation 7,825
                  ft.). Campers can find the trailheads for most of these trails in the main
                  Chisos Basin area a mile or so further down the Basin road from the campground.   \n\nAccess
                  to the river is approximately 30 miles away, where visitors can canoe, kayak
                  and fish.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The group campground is located approximately
                  1/4 mile away from the main Chisos Basin Campground. Each site comes with
                  a picnic table, charcoal grill and bear-proof food storage container and some
                  sites come with picnic shelters for shade. All campsites are within easy walking
                  distance to drinking water and toilets. No RVs, trailers, or generators are
                  allowed.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe national park is named for a
                  curve in the Rio Grande called the \"big bend.\" For 1,250 miles, the river
                  is an International Boundary between the United States and Mexico.   \n\nThe
                  campground lies at the base of several sloping cliffs amidst montane shrubland;
                  desert plants such as Arizona cyprus and mesquite trees fill the landscape.
                  Maple, aspen, pinyon and ponderosa pines grow at higher elevations just above
                  the campground. Though it is lower than the surrounding cliffs, the Chisos
                  Basin is at a higher elevation than other campgrounds within the park. Summer
                  temperatures here are cool, yet warmer than other areas in fall and winter
                  due to the cold air sinking into lower regions.   \n\nThe Chisos Mountains
                  are a popular nesting site for migratory birds. The mountains provide the
                  only nesting ground in the United States for the Colima Warbler, which arrives
                  in mid-April and departs for its wintering grounds in southwestern Mexico
                  by mid-September.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nBig Bend National Park encompasses
                  801,000 acres and the Chisos Basin area is centrally located. This allows
                  visitors an excellent opportunity to explore all areas of the park in a relatively
                  short drive. Big Bend offers excellent hiking trails, miles of rugged dirt
                  roads, and endless possibilities for sightseeing. ","FacilityDirections":"From
