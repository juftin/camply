                  the high desert country that was to become Joshua Tree National Park, rugged
                  individuals tried their luck at cattle ranching, mining, and homesteading.
                  The story of William F. Keys and his family is particularly representative
                  of the hard work and ingenuity it took to settle and prosper in the Mojave
                  Desert. <br/> The ranger-guided tour of the ranch includes the colorful story
                  of the 60 years Bill and Frances spent working together to make a life and
                  raise their five children in this remote location. The ranch house, school
                  house, store, and workshop still stand; the orchard has been replanted; and
                  the grounds are full of the cars, trucks, mining equipment, and spare parts
                  that are a part of the Desert Queen Ranch story.","FacilityDirections":"To
                  find the ranch, pass the entrance to Hidden Valley Campground, turn left at
                  the Y-intersection, follow the road approximately two miles to the locked
                  gate. Your guide will meet you there. (See map.) Please arrive at the ranch
                  gate 15 minutes prior to your tour.","FacilityEmail":"jotr_info@nps.gov","FacilityID":"300004","FacilityLatitude":0,"FacilityLongitude":0,"FacilityMapURL":"","FacilityName":"Joshua
