                  Peak is a forest fire lookout tower that was constructed in 1935 by the Civilian
                  Conservation Corps.  It is a three story enclosed tower with external stairs.  Presently
                  the top room or observation cab is the only rentable space.  Sardine sits
                  at an elevation of 8,138 feet in the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains of Tahoe
                  National Forest, approximately 20 miles from Truckee, California.  The lookout
                  does not have electricity, water or garbage service.  It does have a propane
                  tank to operate propane-powered appliances.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nHiking, mountain
                  biking and off road vehicle use are popular around this lookout.  Stampede
                  and Boca Reservoirs are nearby for fishing, boating and swimming.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe
                  interior of the cab is 14 feet long and 14 feet wide and contains two twin
                  beds, a dry sink, a table and four chairs, three propane lights, a propane
                  cast iron heat stove and  a propane stove/oven for cooking.  A limited assortment
                  of cooking utensils, pots and pans are provided.   There is an accessible
                  vault toilet, a picnic table and fire ring are located outside below the lookout.  Firewood
                  is not provided.  Visitors need to bring their own bedding, toilet paper and
                  other personal items.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe lookout tower sits on
                  a mountain top with spectacular views of Stampede Reservoir, Boca Reservoir,
                  Sardine Valley, Independence Lake, the top of the Sierra Buttes and western
                  Nevada.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nKyburz Flat Interpretive Area, The Boca
                  Townsite Interpretive Area, and a mountain bike loop within Sardine Valley
                  are all nearby.","FacilityDirections":"From the Sierraville Ranger District
