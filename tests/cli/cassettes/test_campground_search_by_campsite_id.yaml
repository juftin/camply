                  Campground is located just above Smith and Morehouse Reservoir on the western
                  edge of the Uinta Mountains in northeastern Utah. The town of Oakley is just
                  14 miles away. Visitors enjoy fishing, canoeing and exploring the Smith and
                  Morehouse Trail.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\n<p>The reservoir is open to motorized
                  boats, though a wake-less speed is enforced, making it an excellent place
                  for canoeing and kayaking. A boat ramp is located on the northwest shore.
                  Anglers enjoy fishing for stocked rainbow trout and other native fish species.
                  <br><br><br>The 12-mile round-trip Smith and Morehouse Trail is popular with
                  hikers and backpackers. The trail begins in the campground and leads through
                  forests, meadows and a marsh before spurring off to Erickson Basin and Island
                  Lake.</p>\\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\\n<p>The campground contains several single
                  and double sites with picnic tables and campfire rings. Vault toilets are
                  provided. Firewood is available for purchase from the host.\_</p>\\n<h2>Natural
                  Features</h2>\\nThe campground is situated within a quarter-mile of the reservoir
                  in a scenic conifer and aspen forest at an elevation of 7,800 feet. Smith
                  and Morehouse Creek runs through the campground. A variety of wildlife makes
                  its home around the reservoir, including moose and deer. Summer temperatures
                  range from 65-75 degrees in the day to 40-50 at night.\\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\\nFor
