                  Rock lies within the San Juan National Forest, between Durango and Pagosa
                  Springs in southwestern Colorado. The Monument encompasses 4,726 acres, preserving
                  hundreds of prehistoric sites that dot the landscape around the twin spires
                  known as Chimney Rock and Companion Rock.\\n</p><p>Home to the ancestors of
                  the modern Pueblo Indians, the site represents spiritual significance to many
                  tribes; the Ancestral Puebloans built more than 200 homes and ceremonial buildings
                  high above the valley floor, probably to be near the twin rock pinnacles.
                  Some ancient structures have been excavated and stabilized for viewing including:
                  Great Kiva, Pit House, Multi-Family Dwelling, and a Chacoan style Great House
                  Pueblo. Many unexcavated structures stimulate the imagination.\\n</p><p>The
                  northeastern-most Chacoan outlier is one of the highest elevation Ancestral
                  Puebloan sites. The mountain peaks to the north and east made it an ideal
                  spot for tracking the movement of the sun and moon. The people of Chimney
                  Rock may have used signal towers at various locations to transmit calendric
                  information to Chaco Canyon.\\n</p><p>The Chimney Rock Interpretive Association
                  (CRIA) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and conducts daily tours and
                  operates the Visitor Center during the season from May 15 through September
                  30. Their mission, in partnership with the San Juan National Forest, is to
                  provide the site's care, protection, and preservation, as well as public interpretation
                  and education, and manage the interpretive program at the Monument under a
                  partnership agreement with the Pagosa Ranger District, USDA Forest Service.
                  CRIA offers both self-guided and guided tours seven days a week. The Visitor
                  Center is open from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily with the exception of special
                  events.</p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<br/><br/>\\n<b>Summary of Fees</b>\\n<br/><br/>\\n<table>\\n
