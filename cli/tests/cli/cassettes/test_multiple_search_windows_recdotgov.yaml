                  Creek Group Campground is located near the southeast shore of Sugar Pine Reservoir
                  in the Tahoe National Forest. Visitors enjoy the area for its fishing, canoeing
                  and hiking opportunities. This facility is operated and maintained by the
                  Tahoe National Forest.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nFishing, canoeing, swimming and
                  boating are popular activities on the reservoir. A trail system for walking
                  and non-motorized biking connects the two group sites at the campground, to
                  the lake and nearby boat ramp.\_\_ The North Fork of the American River is
                  nearby, offering opportunities for additional fishing and swimming. Many miles
                  of hiking, biking and off-road vehicle trails are in the surrounding area.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe
                  campground offers two group campsites, Madrone and Rocky Ridge. Each site
                  can accommodate up to 50 people and 18 vehicles. Both sites are equipped with
                  a central cooking and picnic area, with a large campfire circle and multiple
                  tables.\_ RVs, trailers and tents are allowed within the campground. An unloading
                  area and accessible parking are available within the campground.<h2>Natural
                  Features</h2>\\nThe 160-acre Sugar Pine Reservoir sits at an elevation of
                  3,600 feet. Stands of cedar and ponderosa pine provides ample shade in the
                  campground, which overlooks the reservoir. Summertime temperatures are warm
                  during the day and cool at night.\",\"FacilityDirections\":\"Take Interstate
                  80 to the Foresthill/Auburn exit, near Auburn. Continue east for 17 miles
                  to Foresthill. Travel through town, about 9 miles, to Forest Road 10/Sugar
                  Pine Road. Turn left and continue about 9 miles. Look for the Sugar Pine Recreation
                  Area sign and turn right on the first road after the sign. Continue about
                  a half-mile to the Rocky Ridge Group Campground, on the right, and to the
                  Madrone Group Campground, at the end of the circle.\",\"FacilityEmail\":\"\",\"FacilityID\":\"232045\",\"FacilityLatitude\":39.1311111,\"FacilityLongitude\":-120.7819444,\"FacilityMapURL\":\"\",\"FacilityName\":\"FORBES
