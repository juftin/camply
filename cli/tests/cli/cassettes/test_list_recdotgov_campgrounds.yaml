                  a high, narrow mountain ridge at 5,280 feet, Bear Basin Lookout and Pierson
                  Cabin offer visitors an awe-inspiring experience and a quiet haven away from
                  crowds. Excellent views of the Siskiyou Wilderness to the east and the Pacific
                  Ocean to the west are why visitors love staying in the heart of the Six Rivers
                  National Forest of northern California. \\n<br/><br/>\\nThe current lookout
                  building was previously situated at Camp Six, where it was used to spot forest
                  fires. That structure was moved from Camp Six to Bear Basin Butte in 1996.
                  The original Bear Basin Butte lookout existed in the 1930s. \\n<br/><br/>\\nDuring
                  the summer and early fall months (July 1 - September 30), the rental includes
                  both the lookout tower and a modern 1930s-style cabin built in the 1990s.
                  \\n<br/><br/>\\nThis is a remote location. Access to the cabin is variable
                  and the road is not maintained for winter use. High-clearance, four-wheel
                  drive vehicles are recommended, and guests are also advised to carry chains
                  and a shovel. Guests should note that even during the summer, the paved portion
                  of the road (South Fork Road) frequently has numerous rocks and debris. The
                  last half mile of the access is on a steep gravel road. Quality tires and
                  high-clearance vehicles are recommended. Guests are responsible for their
                  own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nBird
                  watching is available, as well as great hiking opportunities in the nearby
                  Siskiyou Wilderness. Please don't forget to pick up a Siskiyou Wilderness
                  Map at your nearest Forest Service Visitor Center or local outdoor store before
                  venturing into the wilderness. Horseback riding trails may be accessed nearby,
                  and wildlife viewers may catch a glimpse of deer or bears, which make their
                  home in the area.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe lookout and cabin can accommodate
                  up to eight guests, but up to 12 guests are permitted for an extra fee. The
                  cabin has an entry room with a countertop suitable for organizing supplies
                  and preparing food. Three double beds are provided (one of which is a bunk
                  above the other) in the cabin and a futon in the lookout. The cabin also has
                  a four-seat dining table, three chairs, a bench, a book case, and a wood-burning
                  stove (firewood is provided).\\n<br/><br/>\\nBoard games and various books
                  may be available for use. A vault toilet, picnic tables and a campfire ring
                  are outside. No water or electricity is available. Guests should bring plenty
                  of water, food, bedding, flashlights and other basic camp gear (<a href=\\\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/srnf/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=11447&actid=101\\\"

                  Creek Campground is located in the breathtaking Sequoia and Kings Canyon National
                  Parks in central California's rugged Sierra Nevada range. <br/><br/>\\nThe
                  campground is perched at an elevation of 6,700 ft., on the banks of scenic
                  Dorst Creek. Several meadows surround the campground and a number of small
                  streams flow through the site. <br/><br/>\\nA handful of  popular day-hikes
                  begin from or near the campground, including the trail to Lost Grove, a 57-acre
                  grove containing 15 beautiful sequoias.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nDorst Creek lies
                  in the Giant Forest region of Sequoia National Park, where forty miles of
                  trails invite visitors to immerse themselves in the majesty of the ancient
                  groves. <br/><br/>\\nSeveral additional popular hiking and wilderness trailheads
                  are close by, including the Big Trees Trail and the trail to Moro Rock, a
                  granite dome with spectacular views of the Great Western Divide and western
                  half of the park. <br/><br/>\\nTokopah Falls Trail is an easy walk along the
                  Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, leading to an impressive 1,200 ft. waterfall.
                  Fly-fishing is a popular activity on Dorst Creek and the Marble Fork of the
                  Kaweah River.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe campground is very popular with tent
                  and RV campers alike. It has paved roads, flush toilets, and drinking water,
                  but no electricity.   \\nPicnic tables, fire rings, and bear food storage
                  boxes are provided at each site. A free dump station is located on-site.  \\nLodgepole

                  showers and laundry facilities.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\\nLodgepole pine,
                  red fir, and shrubs forest the campground, while towering groves of giant
                  sequoias and craggy granite peaks dot the landscape. <br/><br/>\\nThis region
                  is characterized by warm days and cool nights in the summer and deep snow
                  and cold days in the winter.\\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\\nThe inspiring

                  Lake Group Campground (elevation 6,800 feet) is a remote, rustic facility
                  in the southeastern part of Lassen Volcanic National Park. It is on the eastern
                  shore of Juniper Lake, a popular swimming spot, and offers a fantastic view
                  of Lassen Peak, the largest volcano in the park, towering at 10,457 feet.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nThe
                  main trailheads for Horseshoe Lake, Snag Lake and the interior of the park
                  are within the facility. The Mount Harkness Trail ascends to a historic fire
                  tower that is still in use. Juniper Lake is popular for canoeing, kayaking
                  and swimming; Motorized boating is not permitted.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThis
                  is a tent-only facility with two group sites. Drinking water is not available.
                  It is connected to the rest of Juniper Lake Campground, which is all first-come,
                  first-served. Access is via a 13-mile road (seven miles gravel, six miles
                  roughly paved).  For more information visit <a href=\\\"http://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/camping_in_campgrounds.htm\\\"

                  features, such as mud pots and steam vents, some of which are close to the
                  campground. Lassen Peak is the southernmost active volcano in the Cascades,
                  and the second-most recent volcano to erupt in the lower 48 of the United

                  is a forest fire lookout tower that was constructed in 1934 by the Civilian
                  Conservation Corps, and is one of three remaining examples of the enclosed
                  windmill-style lookout in California. The lookout was actively used every
                  summer until 1975. It is a three-story structure with external stairs. The
                  top room or observation cab is the only rentable space at this time.   This
                  is a popular rental facility that is booked almost every night of the year.
                  \ \\n  \\nCalpine sits at an elevation of 5,980 feet in the Sierra Nevada
                  Mountains of the Tahoe National Forest, approximately 40 miles from Truckee,
                  California. During the summer, renters can drive directly to the base of the
                  tower.  In winter, the road is often closed due to snow and ice so access
                  is by snowshoes, skis or snowmobile.   \\n \\nThe lookout has propaned-powered
                  appliances but does not have electricity or water.  <h2>Recreation</h2>\\nHiking
                  and mountain biking trails are within 15 miles of the lookout. The Pacific
                  Crest Trail can be accessed approximately 20 miles away.\\n  \\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe
                  interior of the cab measures 14' by 14' and currently has two single  twin
                  beds, a dry sink, a table and chairs, three propane lights, a propane heater,
                  a propane stove/oven and a fire finder. A limited assortment of cooking utensils,
                  pots and pans are provided.  The facility has its own propane tank.\\n  \\nAn
                  accessible vault toilet,a picnic table and fire ring are located outside,
                  at the base of the lookout. Firewood is not provided.  When fire restrictions
                  go into effect during the summer, no campfires are permitted. \\n  \\nVisitors
                  should plan on bringing their own bedding, groceries, toilet paper and other
                  personal items. Check-in is after 1:00 pm, check-out is by 12:00 pm.<h2>Natural
                  Features</h2>\\nThe lookout tower sits on a mountain top with views of the
                  Sierra Valley, Haskell Peak to the west, Nevada to the east and Lassen Peak
                  to the far northwest.  The lookout is approximately a half hour  of travel
                  time from Sand Pond, Sardine Lakes and the Lakes Basin Area. Wildlife is abundant
                  in the area.   On a clear night, renters can gaze on an almost endless galaxy
                  of stars and meteorites.\",\"FacilityDirections\":\"From Sierraville, the

                  McCloud River Wintu tribe held Hirz Mountain in reverence and had a name for
                  it in their own language. But it was a white miner, Henry Hirz, who gave the
                  mountain \\nits modern name. Hirz was a gold miner who lived on Hirz Creek
                  in the 1860s and was one of the earliest white men in the McCloud River country.<br/><br/>\\n\\nWhen
                  the lookout was built, it was originally a structure that sat on the ground.
                  The mountain was a strategic location for detecting fires because it had a
                  \\ndirect view into the headwaters of the McCloud River and most of its tributaries.
                  In 1937, the Forest Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) rebuilt
                  the Hirz Mountain\\nLookout cabin and included a garage and outhouse. It was
                  one of the last CCC-era lookouts to be built. In 1949, a steel tower was added,
                  constructed of a steel K-brace\\ntower that stands 20 feet above ground level.<br/><br/>\\n\\nComing
                  here is not for the faint of heart. The access road is rocky and steep with
                  limited visibility - high clearance vehicles are recommended - and the last
                  \\nquarter-mile must be traversed on foot. Those who make the journey are
                  rewarded with unforgettable views of the landscape by day and the stars at
                  night.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nThe main recreational activities at Hirz Mountain
                  Lookout are sightseeing and stargazing, and this is an ideal setting for those
                  with a passion for photography. \\nVisitors may want to bring binoculars to
                  go birding and wildlife watching.<br/><br/>  \\n\\nThere are also opportunities
                  to hike, mountain bike and hunt in the area.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThere are
                  two twin beds and two additional mattresses in the lookout cabin, offering
                  sleeping space for four people. There is a picnic table below the lookout
                  and a vault \\ntoilet in a separate building. Cabinets and dressers are available
                  for storage. Visitors will find cleaning supplies for tidying up the cabin
                  when they leave.<br/><br/> \\n\\nThe lookout has no cooking facilities, linens,
                  bedding, water or electricity. Visitors must bring enough water for the length
                  of their stay, as well as \\ngarbage bags to pack out their trash. Appropriate
                  footwear is recommended for the hike up to the lookout. Other items to consider
                  include food, a cell phone, cook stove,\\nmatches, a cooler with ice, personal
                  items, first aid kit, flashlights or lanterns and extra batteries. A California
                  campfire permit is required for the use of a \\nportable gas stove, jellied

                  Oak Flat Lookout sits the Greenhorn Mountains in the Sequoia National Forest
                  and Sequoia National Monument, about an hour from Bakersfield, California.
                  Perched at an elevation of 4,900 feet, the tower overlooks the scenic Kern
                  River and Kern River Valley and has panoramic views of the mountains, river
                  and valley. \\n<br/><br/>\\nOak Flat Lookout was constructed in 1934 to provide
                  fire detection views along the Kern River Canyon. In the early years of the
                  Forest Service, lookouts provided a crucial link in wild land management,
                  often being the only source of communication and fire detection for many miles.
                  The lookout was operational until the 1980s. \\n<br/><br/>\\nThere is no electricity
                  or water in the lookout. All provisions, including food, water and bedding,
                  must be carried up 40 steep steps to the tower space or pulled hand-over-hand
                  in a small basket pulley system.\\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nBirdwatching and

                  up to four adults.\\n<br/><br/>\\nThe kitchen area includes a propane range,
                  a counter and a sink with a drain. A propane light, fire extinguisher, a bucket
                  and cleaning gear are all provided.\\n<br/><br/>\\nThere is a single vault
                  toilet 100 yards northwest of the lookout, and an outdoor barbecue fire ring
                  and picnic table near the tower.\\n<br/><br/>\\nFor more details, see the

                  hours north of Sacramento.  Crystal Creek flows alongside each campsite.  The
                  campground stays relatively cool due to the creek and to the shade given by
                  a canopy of fir, maple and pine.  Three nearby trails lead to lovely waterfalls.
                  <br/><br/>\\nThe cool, clear waters of Whiskeytown Lake provide endless water
                  activities.  The picturesque mountain setting and extensive forested backcountry
                  offer ample opportunities for hiking and biking.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nDuring
                  the summer heat, swimming, kayaking, sailing, paddle boarding and water skiing
                  are popular on the 3,200 acre lake.  Year round, hiking, mountain biking,
                  horseback riding, gold panning, fishing and picnicking attract visitors.  Hunting
                  is allowed in the appropriate season.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\n<p>Crystal Creek

                  a swing-arm barbecue grill and a lamp pole.  The campground has two campsites
                  both of which share one vault toilet.  Drinking water and electricity are
                  not available.<br><br><br>Due to a steep unpaved entrance road, towing vehicles
                  is prohibited in this campground. The following are prohibited: all trailers,
                  fifth wheels, pop-up campers, cab-over campers and motorhomes. Sleeping in
                  vehicles is not allowed. No overflow parking available.</p>\\n<h2>Natural
                  Features</h2>\\nThe heavy forest canopy and burbling year-round creek make

                  Features</h2>\\n\\n<p>Despite its morbid name, a great diversity of life survives
                  in Death Valley! In this below-sea-level basin, steady drought and record
                  summer heat make Death Valley a land of extremes. Yet, each extreme has a
                  striking contrast. Towering peaks are frosted with winter snow. Rare rainstorms
                  bring vast fields of wildflowers. Lush oases harbor tiny fish and refuge for
                  wildlife and humans.\_\_</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Death Valley has sunk below sea level
                  through geologic processes over time. It lies within the Mojave Desert and
                  is the hottest, driest and lowest location in North America. Despite its extreme
                  climate, the park boasts a diversity of ecosystems, including colorful badlands,
                  snow-covered peaks, desolate sand dunes, rugged canyons and flat, dry basins

                  golden-mantled ground squirrel, and a variety of resident birds, among many
                  others.  The dynamic landscape of the park evolves from geologic processes
                  working over millennia to sculpt granite, marble and other forms of rock.
                  \ Here in the parks are canyons carved by rivers and glaciers, towering rugged
                  peaks and miles of underground caverns.  Found throughout the park are thousands
                  of lakes and ponds and miles of rivers and streams. <br/> <br/>\\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\\nFor

                  Lake Stock Corral  (elevation 6,800 ft.) is a remote and rustic facility in
                  the southeastern part of Lassen Volcanic National Park in northern California.
                  \ It is located within walking distance of Juniper Lake, which is popular
                  for fishing, canoeing, kayaking and swimming.  Several trails are located
                  nearby.  The facility is over one hour from the main park road.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nThe
                  main trailheads for Horseshoe Lake, Snag Lake, and access to the interior
                  of the park are within the facility.  The Mount Harkness Trail ascends to
                  a historic fire tower that is still in use. Longer trails will take you to
                  Butte Lake and Summit Lake.  The Pacific Crest Trail can also be accessed
                  from Juniper Lake and runs through the park.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe stock
                  corral area has two adjacent metal corrals with water troughs.  A vault toilet
                  is located next to the facility for the use of those reserving the corral.
                  \ This facility is remote and accessed on seven miles of a rough gravel road
                  and six miles of roughly paved road.  Drinking water is not available.<h2>Natural
                  Features</h2>\\nThe national park is known for its volcanic history, as well
                  as its diversity of plants and animals.  It contains 300 active volcanic domes
                  and many hydrothermal features, such as mud pots and steam vents.  Lassen
                  Peak is the southernmost active volcano in the Cascades, and the second most
                  recent volcano to erupt in the lower 48 of the United States before Mount
                  Saint Helens.<br/><br/>\\nLassen Volcanic National Park boasts over 700 species
                  of flowering plants and 250 species of vertebrates, including birds, mammals,
                  reptiles and fish.  The park is at the junction of the Cascade Mountains,
                  the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Great Basin, thus providing many unique
                  habitats.\\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\\nThe Caribou Wilderness area is managed
                  by the Forest Service and has numerous trails that are suitable for stock

                  includes the General Grant Tree, the Nation's Christmas Tree and only living
                  memorial to our military veterans. Hike to the beautiful Ella Falls, a 50
                  foot waterfall or to Panoramic Point for a breathtaking view of the high Sierras.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nGroup

                  among many others.\\n<br/> <br/>\\nThe dynamic landscape of the park evolves
                  from geologic processes working over millennia to sculpt granite, marble and
                  other forms of rock. Here in the parks are canyons carved by rivers and glaciers,
                  towering rugged peaks and miles of underground caverns. Found throughout the
                  park are thousands of lakes and ponds and miles of rivers and streams.\\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\\nFor

                  Basin Campground (6,445 feet) is situated in the ruins of an old mining community.
                  Some of the old stonework still exists, including steps leading into a deep
                  pool of Gray Eagle Creek. This campground is within easy reach of many trailheads.
                  The campground also offers a tent only group campsite by reservation only.\_</p>\\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nGold
                  Lakes Basin offers a variety of recreational activities including boating,
                  fishing and hiking. A network of over 30 miles of maintained trails branch
                  out across the area, and the Pacific Crest trail can be easily reached from
                  the trail system. <br/><br/>\\nMany of the trails are open to hiking, biking
                  and horseback riding, including the 1-mile Grassy Lakes Trail, accessible
                  from the campground.<br/>\\n<br/>\\nAt nearby Gold Lake, where a boat ramp
                  is provided, visitors enjoy convenient access to boating and fishing. Once
                  on the water, anglers won't have any trouble trolling for brown and rainbow
                  trout and Mackinaws in the cool, clear waters. <h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe single
                  loop campground offers family campsites and one group tent-only site. One
                  double-family site is also available. Vault toilets, drinking water and trash
                  collection are provided. All sites have fire rings with grills and picnic
                  tables.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\\n<p>The area was formed by glaciers and
                  is characterized by breathtaking mountain scenery--most notably the craggy
                  peaks of the Sierra Buttes and over 20 natural glacial lakes, most of which
                  are accessible by well-maintained hiking trails. The campground sits among
                  fir and aspen trees along Gray Eagle Creek. Mt. Elwell towers to the west.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Nearby
                  Attractions</h2>\\n<p>Visiting Plumas Eureka State Park is a worthy side trip.
                  About 18 miles from the campground, this historic site offers a gift shop,

                  an outdoor experience of tranquility and solitude. <h2>Recreation</h2>\\nThe
                  campground's open meadow areas allow for group games and activities, and a
                  large fire ring provides the perfect place for a nighttime campfire circle
                  and s'mores session. Plaskett Lake, a short one-mile walk from the campground,
                  offers a variety of trout for the fishing enthusiast, as well as canoeing
                  and other non-motorized boating activities. Mendocino National Forest's 913,306
                  acres of mountains and canyons allow for a variety of recreational opportunities,
                  including hiking, backpacking, boating, fishing, hunting, nature study and
                  off-highway vehicle riding. Whether it's deer, birds, rabbits, chipmunks or
                  perhaps the occasional bear, wildlife viewing is always a popular activity
                  for visitors. The area is also an extremely popular destination during hunting
                  season. <h2>Facilities</h2>\\nMasterson offers traditional primitive camping
                  with the added convenience of toilets and running water. The site can hold
                  up to 75 guests and 25 vehicles comfortably. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\\nThe
                  Mendocino National Forest, California's only national forest that is not crossed
                  by a paved road, straddles the eastern spur of the Coastal Mountain Range
                  in northwestern California, just a three-hour drive north of San Francisco
                  and Sacramento. Sprinkled throughout the dense green forest are several lakes,
                  offering visitors additional recreational opportunities against a stunning
                  and secluded backdrop. \\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\\nThe nearby Plaskett
                  Lake Campground  is a family campground that can handle additional visitors
                  for larger parties. The day use site at Plaskett Lake is a great place to
                  spend the day. Plaskett Lake is also planted with trout.\",\"FacilityDirections\":\"From
