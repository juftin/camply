                  away from the 450-acre Big Lake, one of Arizona''s top fishing lakes. Big
                  Lake is known for its trout fishing, with rainbow, cutthroat, brook and Apache
                  trout being the most sought-after species. The recreation area is also popular
                  for hiking, mountain biking, bird watching and wildlife viewing.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe
